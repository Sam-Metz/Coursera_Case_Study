# Coursera_Case_Study
I analyze the data of Fitbit users to derive marketing insights for my stakeholders. This is a case study for my Google Data Analytics Certificate.
## Prompt
* You are a data analyst for a company called Bellabeat. Bellabeat makes wearable fitness devices.
* Your team has been asked to anazlyze trends in smart fitness device usage in an effort to help Bellabeat reach their target market more effectively.
* This data set about fitbit users is provided by the company: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit]
* Questions:
    * What are some trends in smart device usage?
    * How could these trends apply to Bellabeat's customers?
    * How could these trends influence Bellabeat's marketing strategy?
### Phase One: Ask
* Are users wearing the watch as a fashionable accessory? Do they wear it all day?
* Do users frequently log their weight in the device?
* What time of day do users typically exercise?
* How far do users go during a workout?
* How long do users workout for?
* How hard do users workout?
* How much sleep do the users get per night?
### Phase Two: Prepare
* Is the data reliable?
    * For purposes of this case study, I will use this data set. However, it is important to note the we are trying to make a claim about Fitbit users. Therefore, our population would be 38.5 million people. If we wanted to make claims about this population with 95% certainty, we would need a sample size of at leat 385 participants. If this were a real life scenario, I would recommend that we find a more representative data set.
    * Further, the source of this data is Amazon Mechanical Turk. Therefore, this dataset is not random and it was not vetted for bias.
* Is the data the original set?
    * Yes
* Is the data comprehensive?
    * The data includes enough information to allow us to answer our questions about the users included.
* Is the data current?
    * This data set is updated annually.
### Phase Three and Four: Process and Analyze
* Are users wearing the watch as a fashionable accessory? Do they wear it all day?
    * For this task, I used the heartrate_seconds_merged.csv tables. There is one for the first date range (3/12-4/11), and one for the second date range (4/12-5/12). A preview of this table is shown below. A user must be wearing the watch for their heartrate to be tracked. Therefore, this table will show us how long each user wears their watch:
    * ![Heartrate Table Example](heart_rate_table.jpg)
    * First, I cleaned this data by formatting the idâ€™s to a number and expanded the date row to include all information.
    * Second, I uploaded the tables to Bigquery.
    * Third, I applied the following steps to the datasets for both date ranges:
         * I found the number of days that each user was wearing their fitbit during the date range.
            * To do this, I applied the following SQL query to the heartrate table:
            * ![Day Count Query](day_count_query.jpg)
            * Below is the table created by this query:
            * ![Day Count Table Example](Day_Count_Table_Example.png)
                 * I then ran the following query on the table above to find the total number of days per user during the range:
                 * ![Day Count Final Sum Query](Day_Count_Final_Sum_Query.png)
                 * Below is the table that resulted from running this query:
                 * ![Days by User Table Example](Days_By_User_Table_Example.png)
         * Now that I knew the total number of days per user for this date range, I needed to find the number of hours that each user wore the watch during the date range.
            *  To do this, I ran the following query on the original heart rate table:
            *  ![Hour Count Query1](Hour_Count_Query1.png)
            *  This resulted in the following table with the start and end time on each day for each user:
            *  ![Hour Count Table1](Hour_Count_Table1.png)
            *  Then, I ran the following query on the table above to add the total duration per user:
            *  ![Hour Count Query2](Hour_Count_Query2.png)
            *  This resulted in the following table:
            *  ![Hour Count Table2](Hour_Count_table2.png)
            *  I joined this table with the day count table using the following query:
            *  ![Hour Count Query3](Hour_Count_Query3.png)
            *  This resulted in a table that shows the Fitbit Id, total days the fitbit was used, and the total hours the fitbit was used. Below is a snip of the table for the 3/12-4/11 dataset:
            *  ![Hour Count Table3](Hour_Count_Table3.png)
         * Since I applied these steps to both date ranges, I ended up with 2 tables. I combined these tables in Excel  
            *
